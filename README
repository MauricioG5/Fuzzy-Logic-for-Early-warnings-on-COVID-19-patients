# Fuzzy-Logic-for-Early-warnings-on-COVID-19-patients

The code shown here are complementary parts of an assistencial robot for COVID-19 patients.

## EWS
There is a Python file wich is used to save sensors data from the patient as well as an Early Warning Score (EWS) that represents the current state of the patient.
For simulation purposes, the data used for the example are randomic numbers.

Robot Movement:
Complementary with the diagnostic software, there is additionally some Arduino code for Robots movement
